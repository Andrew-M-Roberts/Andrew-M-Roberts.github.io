<p>Me ringing handbells at the Cambridge University Guild dinner at Wolfson College.</p>



<p>I currently ring towerbells regularly at Leeds Minster and St Matthias, Burley as well as other churchs more sporadically and handbells in various locations.</p>



<p>
There are many interesting theoretical aspects of bellringing which seem to be very poorly documented online. I do not claim to be able to fully address this but may write about some of the things I notice and find interesting.</br>
I have also recently been interested in the problem of trying to fit four “quarter peals” into a “peal”. More to follow in the hopefully near future…
